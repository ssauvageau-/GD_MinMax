[Band of Black Ice](http://gracefuldusk.appspot.com/items/4225-Band-of-Black-Ice), and its Empowered version, are an example of this.  For such items, they are not included in the data so as to save space. Also note that stats that do not vary (e.g., +skills) are not included in the data as well, with the exception of an item's name, its % variance stat, and its level requirement (as applicable, some items don't have level requirements).\r\n\r\nStats are organized by stat-name/min/base/max for those which do vary.\r\n\r\nSee an error? Let me know by sending me a PM on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/DefinitelyNotCeno/) or on the [Grim Dawn forums](http://grimdawn.com/forums/member.php?u=12951).\r\n",
